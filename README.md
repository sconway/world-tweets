# Tweet Visualizer with React/Redux

This project is intended as a visualization tool for tweets around the world, with
interactive countries and tweets. It is built using Node, Express, and the Twitter
API on the back-end. The front-end uses React, Redux, THREE.js, and Socket.io.

# Usage

Clone this repository, update the config.js file with your twitter API keys( or use mine :) ), then run:

```sh
cd world-tweets
npm install
npm start
```

Navigate to http://localhost:1243
